This pivotal moment marked the beginning of my programming career.\r\n\r\nToday, I’m proud to be part of Agencify, a dynamic startup that empowers independent agents to conduct business seamlessly through our app. Here, I leverage my skills to build and enhance our platform, ensuring it meets the needs of our users.\r\n\r\nMy mission is to demystify programming for beginners, sharing the insights and knowledge I’ve accumulated over the years. As a mostly self-taught developer and an alumnus of Moringa School, I understand the challenges newcomers face and aim to make their learning journey smoother. I’m also part of Hutsy Devs, a platform dedicated to helping beginners get started with Android app development.\r\n\r\nWhen I’m not immersed in code, I’m creating music as a beatmaker. I love experimenting with sounds and producing beats using FL Studio. This creative outlet keeps me inspired and balanced.",
